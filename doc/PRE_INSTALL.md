Please note that this application only interfaces with **dedicated, public IP VPNs accepting inbound traffic**, 
preferably with an associated `.cube` (or `.ovpn/.conf`) configuration file.

**Do not** expect that any VPN you randomly bought on the Internet can be used! 

Checkout the [list of known compatible providers](https://yunohost.org/providers/vpn) for more info.
    
After installation, you will be able to configure the application from YunoHost's webadmin in Applications > VPNclient > Configuration
