Please note that this application is designed to interface with **dedicated, public IP VPNs accepting inbound traffic**, preferably with an associated `.cube` (or `.ovpn/.conf`) configuration file. **Do not** expect that any VPN you randomly bought on the Internet can be used! Checkout the [list of known compatible providers](https://yunohost.org/providers/vpn) for more info.
